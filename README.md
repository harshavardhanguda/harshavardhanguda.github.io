 Hey, I am Harsha Vardhan Guda. You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JXQZv25PaiI0OQA5w9fvE2rqRlA9oaS1)
I am doing my Under Graduation in Electronics and Communication in National Institue of Technology Calicut. 
I am enthusiastic about robotics and machine learning, and also an active member of Robotics Interest Group, NIT Calicut [RIG-NITC](http://www.rignitc.com/team-rig-nitc/)






#Briefly about my projects

### Riggu -Socially Interactive Robot
RIGGU is a Semi Humanoid Interactive bot which is developed for different applications such as hospitality, treating autism, assisting aged people, etc. Semi-Humanoid robots are being widely used in applications ranging from household to commercial purposes. This paper discusses about development of a semi-humanoid robot platform for speech and image recognition, navigation based on Robot Operating System (ROS) which allows the users to interface the robot developed to add) extra peripherals which further gives the scope for development. RIGGU is integrated with features such as speech recognition and synthesis, facial and object recognition and navigation. For [code](https://github.com/harshavardhanguda/rigguv2), [paper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vHjzMZ-WHZ1U1Jf-alBCXW7l6LPH4T6j)
### Quadcopter
 Design of an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) system to detect people in distress and send the information of the people to an already established ground control station(GCS). It consists of a long range communication system to communicate with GCS and a system to perform computer vision, avoid obstacles and navigate autonomously and plan its path accordingly. Further it can be used to build a swarm of such systems to cover a wider area and effectively help more people in distress. It involves development of a fully operational drone with PID control of drone, computer vision, image processing, GPS tracking and navigation, data transfer and acquisition.
### Indian Sign Language to Text Conversion
The exchange of information performed in different ways such as speech, signals, or writing is called communication. Communication in deaf and mute is performed with the use of sign languages, however, they face many difficulties at the time of interacting with the common man and computers. Research is needed in this field to bring deaf-mutes more into the light of society and to increase their interaction with the common man. Our project aims at developing a system that uses Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Faster R-CNN to extract the patterns in the feature vectors of each sign of twenty-six alphabets and further uses the results to recognize those signs. A standalone device is developed by implementing the pre-trained modified VGGNet models on  Pi 3 A+ device.

### Manual Robot for Robocon - 2018
Algorithm for motion of manual robot (four wheeled) to acheive the task of handingover shuttlecock to autonomous robot.  Coding of AVR Microcontrollers for control ofrobot and design of power modules. Implemented algorithms to recognise shuttlecocks based on location and produce appropriate signals to throw it in required tragectory. 



### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/harshavardhanguda/harshavardhanguda.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
